Welcome to the <u><b>V</b>isualization and <b>D</b>ata <b>S</b>cience (VDS) Group</u> at the <a href="https://www.iitk.ac.in">Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur (IITK)</a>. We are part of the <a href="https://www.cse.iitk.ac.in/">Department of Computer Science and Engineering</a>. Our research lies at the unique intersection of <b>data science, machine (deep) learning, visualization, visual computing, big data analytics, and high-performance computing</b>. We develop state-of-the-art data analytics, machine learning, and visualization techniques to accelerate data-driven discoveries in diverse application domains. Summarizing, extracting, and comprehending the crux from the vast seas of data and representing them visually and interactively in an interpretable manner is the broad-scale focus of our research.</p>

<p>To achieve our goal, we build data science and machine (deep) learning-based solutions to analyze extreme-scale multifaceted data in a scalable way, enabling interactive and interpretable analytics of the large-scale complex data. We are focused on developing and analyzing technqiues that make complex machine learning models more interpretable and explainable so that they can be trusted and adopted in real-life applications effectviely. Our research seeks to address various characteristics of the big data, including its fundamental 5 Vs: <b>Volume, Velocity, Variety, Veracity, and Value</b>. We study extreme-scale data from scientific simulations using modern high performance computing and machine learning capabilities to advance research in various domains such as climate modeling and weather forecasting, chemical reactor design, combustion science, computational fluid dynamics, etc. We are also actively focused on building scalable and novel interactive visual analytics systems to analyze diverse types of data generated via social media, IoT, various sensors, engineering design, healthcare, and many other industry applications. </p></div>
