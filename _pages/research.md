Data-driven solutions, nowadays, have become omnipresent. While on one hand, high-resolution scientific models simulate petabytes of data at a rapid pace using modern high performance computing capabilities to study various types of intricate process and physical phenomena, on the other hand, diverse types of extreme-scale data also gets generated via social media, IoT, sensors, and various industry applications. Summarizing, extracting, and comprehending the crux from these vast seas of data and representing them visually and interactively in an interpretable manner is the broad-scale focus of our research. To achieve our goal, we develop novel statistical and machine learning-based data science approaches to analyze extreme-scale data sets in a scalable fashion and enable interactive and interpretable visual analytics of the data for addressing problems from a wide range of scientific and industry applications. Our big data research seeks to address various aspects of the big data, including the fundamental 5 Vs: Volume, Velocity, Variety, Veracity, and Value.</div>
