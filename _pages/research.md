Welcome to the <u><b>V</b>isualization and <b>D</b>ata <b>S</b>cience (VDS) Laboratory</u> at the <a href="https://www.iitk.ac.in">Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur (IITK)</a>. We are part of the <a href="https://www.cse.iitk.ac.in/">Department of Computer Science and Engineering</a>. Our research lies at the unique intersection of <b>data science, visualization, machine learning, computer graphics, and big data analytics</b>. We develop state-of-the-art data analytics, visualization, and computer graphics techniques to accelerate scientific discoveries in diverse application domains. Summarizing, extracting, and comprehending the crux from the vast seas of data and representing them visually and interactively in an interpretable manner is the broad-scale focus of our research.</p>

<p>To achieve our goal, we build data science, data analytics, and machine learning-based solutions to analyze extreme-scale multifaceted data in a scalable way, enabling interactive and interpretable analytics of the large-scale complex data. Our research seeks to address various characteristics of the big data, including its fundamental 5 Vs: <b>Volume, Velocity, Variety, Veracity, and Value</b>. We study extreme-scale data from scientific simulations using modern high performance computing capabilities to advance research in various scientific domains such as climate modeling and weather forecasting, chemical reactor design, combustion science, turbine compressor design, computational fluid dynamics, etc. We are also actively focused on building scalable and novel interactive visual analytics systems to analyze diverse types of data generated via social media, IoT, various sensors, engineering design, healthcare, and many other industry applications. </p></div>
