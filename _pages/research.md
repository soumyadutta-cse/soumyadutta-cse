<p>Welcome to the Visualization and Data Science (VDS) Laboratory at the Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur (IITK). Our research aims to develop novel state-of-the-art data analytics, visualization, and computer graphics techniques to accelerate scientific discoveries in diverse application domains. Summarizing, extracting, and comprehending the crux from the vast seas of data and representing them visually and interactively in an interpretable manner is the broad-scale focus of our research.</p>

<p>To achieve our goal, we build novel data science and machine learning-based solutions to analyze extreme-scale multifaceted data in a scalable manner, enabling interactive and interpretable visual analytics of the large-scale complex data. Our research seeks to address various characteristics of the big data, including its fundamental 5 Vs: Volume, Velocity, Variety, Veracity, and Value.</p>

<p>We study extreme-scale data from high-resolution scientific simulations using modern high performance computing capabilities to further research in various scientific domains such as climate modeling and weather forecasting, chemical reactor design, combustion science, turbine compressor design, computational fluid dynamics, etc. We are also actively focused on building scalable and novel interactive visual analytics systems to explore diverse types of data generated via social media, IoT, various sensors, engineering design, healthcare, and other industry applications. </p></div>
