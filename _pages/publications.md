        The study of multiphase flow is essential for designing chemical reactors such as fluidized bed reactors (FBR), as a detailed understanding of hydrodynamics is critical for optimizing reactor performance and stability. During complex chemical processes in an FBR, the formation of void regions in the reactor, generally termed as bubbles, is an important phenomenon. The study of these bubbles has a deep implication in predicting the reactor's overall efficiency. But physical experiments needed to understand bubble dynamics are costly and non-trivial due to the technical difficulties involved and harsh working conditions of the reactors. Therefore, to study such chemical processes and bubble dynamics, a state-of-the-art computational simulation MFIX-Exa is being developed. Despite the proven accuracy of MFIX-Exa in modeling bubbling phenomena, the large-scale output data prohibits the use of traditional post hoc analysis capabilities in both storage and I/O time. To address these issues and allow the application scientists to explore the bubble dynamics in an efficient and timely manner, we have developed an end-to-end analytics pipeline that enables in situ detection of bubbles, followed by a flexible post hoc visual exploration methodology of bubble dynamics. The proposed method enables interactive analysis of bubbles, along with quantification of several bubble characteristics, enabling experts to understand the bubble interactions in detail. Positive feedback from the experts has indicated the efficacy of the proposed approach for exploring bubble dynamics in very-large-scale multiphase flow simulations.

        Modern scientific simulations produce very large datasets, making interactive exploration of such data computationally prohibitive. An increasingly common data reduction technique is to store visualizations and other data extracts in a database. The Cinema project is one such approach, storing visualizations in an image database for post hoc exploration and interactive image-based analysis. This work focuses on developing efficient algorithms that can quantify various types of multivariate dependencies existing within multi-variable datasets. It applies specific mutual information measures for the quantification of salient regions from multivariate image data. Using such information measures, the opacity of the images is modulated so that the salient regions are automatically highlighted and the domain scientists can interactively explore the most relevant regions for scientific discovery.

        In situ analysis has emerged as a dominant paradigm for performing scalable visual analysis of extreme-scale computational simulation data. Compared to the traditional post hoc analysis pipeline where data is first stored into disks and then analyzed offline, in situ analysis processes data at the time its generation in the supercomputers so that the slow and expensive disk I/O is minimized. In this work, we present a new in situ visual analysis pipeline for the extreme-scale multiphase flow simulation MFiX-Exa and demonstrate how the pipeline can be used to process large particle fields in situ and produce informative visualizations of the data features. We deploy our analysis pipeline on Oak Ridge's Summit supercomputer to study its in situ applicability and usefulness.

        Given the promises model-based visualization techniques have shown and acknowledging their absolute necessity for driving future visualization of big data, we believe that now is the time to dive deep into this research direction to get prepared to handle, visualize, and analyze the exascale data interactively. Unprecedented advancements in the development of deep learning and sophisticated statistical techniques have been made possible by the arrival of big data and the continuous growth of computing capabilities. It is only appropriate for the visualization community to take advantage of these new technologies to the fullest extent to address the grand challenge problem of interactive visualization of extreme-scale data augmented with uncertainty quantification and visualization capabilities to accelerate scientific discovery for the future.

        Viscous and gravitational flow instabilities cause a displacement front to break up into finger-like fluids. The detection and evolutionary analysis of these fingering instabilities are critical in multiple scientific disciplines such as fluid mechanics and hydrogeology. However, previous detection methods of the viscous and gravitational fingers are based on density thresholding, which provides limited geometric information of the fingers. The geometric structures of fingers and their evolution are important yet little studied in the literature. In this work, we explore the geometric detection and evolution of the fingers in detail to elucidate the dynamics of the instability. We propose a ridge voxel detection method to guide the extraction of finger cores from three-dimensional (3D) scalar fields. After skeletonizing finger cores into skeletons, we design a spanning tree based approach to capture how fingers branch spatially from the finger skeletons. Finally, we devise a novel geometric-glyph augmented tracking graph to study how the fingers and their branches grow, merge, and split over time. Feedback from earth scientists demonstrates the usefulness of our approach to performing spatio-temporal geometric analyses of fingers.

        Scientists nowadays use data sets generated from large-scale scientific computational simulations to understand the intricate details of various physical phenomena. These simulations produce large volumes of data at a rapid pace, containing thousands of time steps so that the spatio-temporal dynamics of the modeled phenomenon and its associated features can be captured with sufficient detail. Storing all the time steps into disks to perform traditional offline analysis will soon become prohibitive as the gap between the data generation speed and disk I/O speed continues to increase. In this work, we present an information-theoretic approach for in situ reduction of large-scale time-varying data sets via a combination of key and fused time steps. We show that this approach can greatly minimize the output data storage while preserving the temporal evolution of data. A detailed in situ application study is carried out to demonstrate the in situ viability of our technique for efficiently summarizing thousands of time steps generated from a large-scale real-life computational simulation code.

        The study of many extreme weather events requires simulations with high spatiotemporal data that can grow in size quickly. Storing all the raw data from such a large-scale simulation for traditional post hoc analyses is soon going to be prohibitive as the data generation speed is outpacing the data storage capability in supercomputers. In situ analysis has emerged as a solution to this problem; data is analyzed when it is being produced, bypassing the slower disk input/output (I/O). In this work, we develop an in situ analysis pathway for Energy Exascale Earth System Model (E3SM) and propose an algorithm for analyzing the impacts of sudden stratospheric warmings (SSWs), which can cause extreme cold temperature outbreaks at the surface, resulting in hazardous weather and disrupting many socioeconomic sectors. We detect SSWs and model the surface temperature data distributions in situ and show that post hoc analysis using the distribution models can predict the impact of SSWs in the continental United States.

        Application scientists often employ feature tracking algorithms to capture the temporal evolution of various features in their simulation data. However, as the complexity of the scientific features is increasing with the advanced simulation modeling techniques, quantification of reliability of the feature tracking algorithms is becoming important. One of the desired requirements for any robust feature tracking algorithm is to estimate its confidence during each tracking step so that the results obtained can be interpreted without any ambiguity. To address this, we develop a confidence-guided feature tracking algorithm that allows reliable tracking of user-selected features and presents the tracking dynamics using a graph-based visualization along with the spatial visualization of the tracked feature. The efficacy of the proposed method is demonstrated by applying it to two scientific data sets containing different types of time-varying features.

        Although supercomputers are becoming increasingly powerful, their components have thus far not scaled proportionately. Compute power is growing enormously and is enabling finely resolved simulations that produce never-before-seen features. However, I/O capabilities lag by orders of magnitude, which means only a fraction of the simulation data can be stored for post hoc analysis. Prespecified plans for saving features and quantities of interest do not work for features that have not been seen before. Data-driven intelligent sampling schemes are needed to detect and save important parts of the simulation while it is running. Here, we propose a novel sampling scheme that reduces the size of the data by orders-of-magnitude while still preserving important regions. The approach we develop selects points with unusual data values and high gradients. We demonstrate that our approach outperforms traditional sampling schemes on a number of tasks.

        As we enter the exascale computing regime, powerful supercomputers continue to produce much higher amounts of data than what can be stored for offline data processing. To utilize such high compute capabilities on these machines, much of the data processing needs to happen in situ, when the full high-resolution data is available at the supercomputer memory. In this article, we discuss our MFiX-Exa simulation, which models multiphase flow by tracking a very large number of particles through the simulation domain. In one of the use cases, the carbon particles interact with air to produce carbon dioxide bubbles from the reactor. These bubbles are of primary interest to the domain experts for these simulations. For this particle-based simulation, we propose a streaming technique that can be deployed in situ to efficiently identify the bubbles, track them over time, and use them to down-sample the data with minimal loss in these features.

        We extend the definition of the classic instantaneous vector field saddles, sinks, and sources to the finite-time setting by categorizing the domain based on the behavior of the flow map w.r.t. contraction or expansion. Since the intuitive Lagrangian approach turns out to be unusable in practice because it requires advection in unstable regions, we provide an alternative, sufficient criterion that can be computed in a robust way. We show that both definitions are objective, relate them to existing approaches, and show how the generalized critical points and their separatrices can be visualized.

Despite the proven accuracy of MFIX-Exa in modeling bubbling phenomena, the large-scale output data prohibits the use of traditional post hoc analysis capabilities in both storage and I/O time. To address these issues and allow the application scientists to explore the bubble dynamics in an efficient and timely manner, we have developed an end-to-end analytics pipeline that enables in situ detection of bubbles, followed by a flexible post hoc visual exploration methodology of bubble dynamics. The proposed method enables interactive analysis of bubbles, along with quantification of several bubble characteristics, enabling experts to understand the bubble interactions in detail. Positive feedback from the experts has indicated the efficacy of the proposed approach for exploring bubble dynamics in very-large-scale multiphase flow simulations.

        The study of multiphase flow is essential for designing chemical reactors such as fluidized bed reactors (FBR), as a detailed understanding of hydrodynamics is critical for optimizing reactor performance and stability. During complex chemical processes in an FBR, the formation of void regions in the reactor, generally termed as bubbles, is an important phenomenon. The study of these bubbles has a deep implication in predicting the reactor's overall efficiency.

        The study of multiphase flow is essential for designing chemical reactors such as fluidized bed reactors (FBR), as a detailed understanding of hydrodynamics is critical for optimizing reactor performance and stability. During complex chemical processes in an FBR, the formation of void regions in the reactor, generally termed as bubbles, is an important phenomenon. The study of these bubbles has a deep implication in predicting the reactor's overall efficiency. But physical experiments needed to understand bubble dynamics are costly and non-trivial due to the technical difficulties involved and harsh working conditions of the reactors. Therefore, to study such chemical processes and bubble dynamics, a state-of-the-art computational simulation MFIX-Exa is being developed. Despite the proven accuracy of MFIX-Exa in modeling bubbling phenomena, the large-scale output data prohibits the use of traditional post hoc analysis capabilities in both storage and I/O time. To address these issues and allow the application scientists to explore the bubble dynamics in an efficient and timely manner, we have developed an end-to-end analytics pipeline that enables in situ detection of bubbles, followed by a flexible post hoc visual exploration methodology of bubble dynamics. The proposed method enables interactive analysis of bubbles, along with quantification of several bubble characteristics, enabling experts to understand the bubble interactions in detail. Positive feedback from the experts has indicated the efficacy of the proposed approach for exploring bubble dynamics in very-large-scale multiphase flow simulations.
