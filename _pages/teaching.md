## Upcoming Course (Semester 2022-23-II): CS798E - Big Data Visual Analytics

### Prerequisites: 
Basics of Linear Algebra, Statistics, and Probability theory will be beneficial but not mandatory, knowledge in programming (C/C++, Python)

### Course Description:
The necessity of visual analytics capabilities for big data is becoming omnipresent due to its significant demand in the current age of data science and analytics. Interactive data visualization techniques enable us to comprehend and explore diverse types of complex data sets efficiently so that patterns and features from the data can be readily identified and studied in detail. As the data grows larger and becomes intricate, it poses significant challenges to manage, curate, and explore such large data sets in a scalable manner. These data sets can come from various scientific simulations as well as from social media, IoT, various sensors, and many other industry and application domains. In this course, we will cover a comprehensive view of data visualization techniques with a specific focus on the techniques that are applicable to big data. We will discuss the theory and foundations of visualization techniques and have hands-on exercises on visualizing different types of data sets using available visualization software and libraries. We will study scientific and information visualization techniques with a focus on data compression, statistical and information theory techniques, and selected high-performance visualization algorithms. Next, we will discuss how modern machine learning and deep learning techniques are adapted for big data visual analytics. Finally, we will learn about exascale visual computing and state-of-the-art in situ analysis techniques and conclude by discussing the future paradigms of the big data visual analytics domain. 

The contents for this course will be based on a few books and research papers from top-tier journals and conferences such as IEEE TVCG, CGF, ACM CHI, IEEE/ACM Supercomputing, IEEE Visualization, EuroVis and EuroGraphics, IEEE Pacific Visualization, IEEE LDAV, EGPGV, etc.
