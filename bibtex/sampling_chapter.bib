abstract="With exascale supercomputers on the horizon, data-driven in situ data reduction is a very important topic that potentially enables post hoc data visualization, reconstruction, and exploration with the goal of minimal information loss. Sophisticated sampling methods provide a fast approximation to the data that can be used as a preview to the simulation output without the need for full data reconstruction. More detailed analysis can then be performed by reconstructing the sampled data set as necessary. Other data reduction methods such as compression techniques can still be used with the sampled outputs to achieve further data reduction. Sampling can be achieved in the spatial domain (which data locations are to be stored?) and/or temporal domain (which time steps to be stored?). Given a spatial location, data-driven sampling approaches take into account its local properties (such as scalar value, local smoothness etc.) and multivariate association among scalar values to determine the importance of a location. For temporal sampling, changes in the local and global properties across time steps are taken into account as importance criteria. In this chapter, spatial sampling approaches are discussed for univariate and multivariate data sets and their use for effective in situ data reduction is demonstrated.",
