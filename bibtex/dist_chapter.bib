abstract="As the era of exascale computing approaches, the need for effective, scalable, and flexible data reduction techniques is becoming more and more prominent. As discussed in the introductory chapter, this need is primarily due to the bottleneck stemming from output data size and I/O speed compared to the ever-increasing computing speed. With this chapter, we consider a promising solution: data summarization techniques that work in the in situ environment while the data is getting produced, and preserve the important information from the data compactly, which minimizes information loss and enables a variety of post hoc analyses. Specifically, this chapter shows that statistical distribution-based in situ data summaries are a pragmatic solution and able to preserve important statistical data features. Using only the in situ generated statistical data summaries, which is significantly smaller in size compared to the original raw data, a wide range of data analysis and visualization tasks can be performed such as feature detection, extraction, tracking, query-driven analysis, etc. In addition, reconstruction of the full-resolution data is also possible, in order to visualize the data in its entirety with the added advantage of uncertainty quantification. To this end, this chapter presents several distribution-based data modeling algorithms, considering both their in situ performance and the usefulness of their distribution data summaries on several application studies.",
