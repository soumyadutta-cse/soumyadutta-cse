abstract="Cinema is a flexible in situ visualization ecosystem that combines data extracts with viewers and analysis capabilities to support in situ, post hoc and hybrid approaches for data processing. With data extracts that include metadata, images, meshes, and other data types, Cinema databases generated in situ are a central component of post hoc analysis workflows. These workflows support visualization and exploration of data, verification and validation tasks, and leverage computer vision and statistical techniques for post hoc analysis. This chapter describes the Cinema approach, its database specification, and demonstrates its use through example workflows.",
