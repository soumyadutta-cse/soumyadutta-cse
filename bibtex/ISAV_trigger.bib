abstract = {Triggers are an important mechanism for adapting visualization, analysis, and storage actions. With this work, we describe the Ascent in situ infrastructure's system for triggers. This system splits triggers into two components: when to perform an action and what actions to perform. The decision for when to perform an action can be based on different types of factors, such as mesh topology, scalar fields, or performance data. The actions to perform are also varied, ranging from the traditional action of saving simulation state to disk to performing arbitrary visualizations and analyses. We also include details on the implementation and short examples demonstrating how the system can be used.},
